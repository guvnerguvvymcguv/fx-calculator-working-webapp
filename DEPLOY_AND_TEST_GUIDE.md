## ✅ All Fixes Applied Successfully!

Three critical issues have been fixed:

### 1. ✅ Data Query Fixed
- Now properly fetches junior users first
- Then queries their calculations from activity_logs
- Includes comprehensive logging

### 2. ✅ Date Range Fixed  
- Test mode uses CURRENT month (October 2024)
- Production mode uses PREVIOUS month
- Clear logging shows which mode is active

### 3. ✅ Email Delivery
- Already properly configured with Resend
- No changes needed!

```

### What You Should See (Failure - No Data):

If you still see this:
```
Found 0 clients with 0 total calculations
No activity for spread checker last month - skipping
```

**Then check:**
1. Database has `client_data_enabled = true` for your company
2. Junior user has `role_type = 'junior'`
3. Junior user has `is_active != false` (or is_active IS NULL)
4. Calculations exist in October 2024 with `action_type = 'calculation'`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No activity for spread checker last month"

**Solution:** Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check company settings
SELECT id, name, client_data_enabled, monthly_reports_enabled 
FROM companies 
WHERE name ILIKE '%spread%';

-- Check junior users
SELECT id, email, full_name, role_type, is_active, company_id
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE role_type = 'junior';

-- Check October calculations
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_calculations,
  client_name,
  MIN(created_at) as first_calc,
  MAX(created_at) as last_calc
FROM activity_logs 
WHERE action_type = 'calculation'
  AND created_at >= '2024-10-01'
  AND created_at <= '2024-10-31'
GROUP BY client_name
ORDER BY total_calculations DESC;
```

### Issue: Email not arriving

**Check:**
1. ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Supabase Edge Function secrets
2. ✅ Admin email address is correct in user_profiles
3. ✅ Check spam/junk folder
4. ✅ Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
5. ✅ Check Edge Function logs for Resend errors

### Issue: PDF generation fails

**Check Edge Function logs for:**
- Memory errors (PDF might be too large)
- Missing data fields
- Calculation errors in statistics
