# Monthly Client Reports - Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Data Query Problem - "Found 0 clients with 0 total calculations"

**Problem:** The query was not properly fetching calculations from junior users.

**Solution:** Modified `/supabase/functions/generate-monthly-report/queries.ts`
- Now explicitly fetches all junior users for the company first
- Then queries activity_logs using those user IDs
- Added proper filtering for `action_type = 'calculation'`
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Skips calculations without client names

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Used complex join that wasn't working
.select(`
  *,
  user_profiles!inner (
    id,
    full_name,
    company_id
  )
`)
.eq('user_profiles.company_id', companyId)

// After: Fetch users first, then filter calculations
const { data: juniorUsers } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('id, full_name')
  .eq('company_id', companyId)
  .eq('role_type', 'junior')
  .neq('is_active', false);

const { data: calculations } = await supabase
  .from('activity_logs')
  .select('*')
  .in('user_id', juniorUserIds)
  .eq('action_type', 'calculation')
  .gte('created_at', startDate)
  .lte('created_at', endDate)
```

### 2. âœ… Date Range Issue - Testing with Current Month

**Problem:** Function was looking at "last month" data, but for testing you need "this month".

**Solution:** Modified `/supabase/functions/generate-monthly-report/index.ts`
- Added smart date range selection based on test mode
- Test mode (when company_id is provided): Uses CURRENT month
- Production mode (scheduled run): Uses PREVIOUS month
- Added clear logging to show which mode is active

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
if (testCompanyId) {
  // TEST MODE: Use current month
  firstDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1);
  lastDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() + 1, 0);
  lastDay.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  console.log('ðŸ§ª TEST MODE: Using CURRENT month data');
} else {
  // PRODUCTION MODE: Use previous month
  firstDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() - 1, 1);
  lastDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 0);
  lastDay.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  console.log('ðŸš€ PRODUCTION MODE: Using PREVIOUS month data');
}
```

### 3. âœ… Email Delivery - Resend Integration

**Status:** Already properly implemented! âœ¨

The `/supabase/functions/generate-monthly-report/sendEmail.ts` file was already correctly configured with Resend:
- Uses `RESEND_API_KEY` from environment variables
- Sends from `reports@spreadchecker.co.uk`
- Includes beautiful HTML email template
- Attaches PDF report correctly as base64
- Proper error handling

## Files Modified

1. **queries.ts** - Fixed data fetching logic
2. **index.ts** - Fixed date range for test vs production mode
3. **sendEmail.ts** - No changes needed (already perfect!)
4. **generatePDF.ts** - No changes needed

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Deploy the Changes
```bash
cd /Users/rossj/Desktop/broker-pitch-calc/fx-calculator-working-webapp
supabase functions deploy generate-monthly-report
```

### 2. Test via UI
1. Go to your Account Management page
2. Scroll to "Client Data Reports" section
3. Click "Send Test Report"
4. Check Supabase Edge Function logs
5. Check admin email inbox

### 3. What to Look For in Logs

**Success Logs:**
```
ðŸ§ª TEST MODE: Using CURRENT month data
ðŸ“Š Fetching calculations for company: [company-id]
ðŸ“… Date range: [start] to [end]
Found junior users: 1 [user-ids]
Calculations query result: 98 records found
Grouped into X unique clients
Found X clients with 98 total calculations
âœ… PDF generated successfully, size: XXXX bytes
Sending to X admins...
âœ… Email sent to [email]
Email sent successfully: [resend-response]
```

**What Each Part Means:**
- `TEST MODE` = Using current month (October 2024) data
- `Found junior users: 1` = Found your junior broker
- `Calculations query result: 98` = Found your 98 calculations
- `Grouped into X unique clients` = Organized by client names
- `PDF generated` = Report created successfully
- `Email sent successfully` = Delivered via Resend

## Expected Behavior

### When You Click "Send Test Report":

1. âœ… Function fetches your company data
2. âœ… Checks `client_data_enabled = true`
3. âœ… Gets all junior users for your company
4. âœ… Queries their calculations from CURRENT month (October 2024)
5. âœ… Groups calculations by client name
6. âœ… Calculates statistics (avg trade value, currency pairs, savings, etc.)
7. âœ… Generates professional PDF report
8. âœ… Sends email to all admins with PDF attached
9. âœ… Shows success message with admin count

### Email Content:

**Subject:** `Spread Checker - Client Data Report (October 2024)`

**Includes:**
- Active Clients count
- Total Calculations (98)
- Combined Monthly Savings
- PDF attachment with:
  - Cover page with summary
  - Individual client pages with:
    - Currency pairs used
    - Trading volume
    - Average trade values
    - Savings metrics
    - Complete calculation details

## Common Issues & Solutions

### If you still get "No activity":
1. Check that `client_data_enabled = true` in the companies table
2. Verify junior user has `role_type = 'junior'`
3. Verify junior user has `is_active != false`
4. Check calculations have `action_type = 'calculation'` in activity_logs
5. Check calculations have `client_name` field populated

### If email doesn't arrive:
1. Check Resend API key is set in Supabase Edge Function environment
2. Check spam folder
3. Verify admin email in user_profiles table
4. Check Supabase Edge Function logs for Resend errors

### To Check Database:
```sql
-- Check company settings
SELECT id, name, client_data_enabled, monthly_reports_enabled 
FROM companies WHERE name = 'spread checker';

-- Check junior users
SELECT id, email, full_name, role_type, is_active 
FROM user_profiles WHERE role_type = 'junior';

-- Check calculations
SELECT COUNT(*), client_name 
FROM activity_logs 
WHERE action_type = 'calculation' 
AND created_at >= '2024-10-01'
GROUP BY client_name;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test** - Click "Send Test Report" and verify email arrives
2. **Review PDF** - Check that client data is accurately represented
3. **Production Ready** - Once tested, the scheduled monthly run will work automatically
4. **Monitor** - Check Edge Function logs on the 1st of each month

## Questions or Issues?

If something isn't working:
1. Check Supabase Edge Function logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set (RESEND_API_KEY)
3. Check database has proper data structure
4. Review this document for troubleshooting steps
